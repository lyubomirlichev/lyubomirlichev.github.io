{: .prompt-tip }


As a Senior Software Engineer with a passion for AR and VR development, I am excited to be at the forefront of creating immersive and innovative experiences.

I believe that XR technology has the power to create unforgettable moments and unique business opportunities.

My technical skills include expertise in Unity 3D, C#, Swift, iOS, Meta Quest, Hololens 2, and various other VR headsets, as well as experience with platforms, DevOps, CI/CD. In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and team player, with the ability to work effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

In my current role, I am working on a suite of tools for studios and brands to easily create immersive connected experiences. In my previous roles, I have worked on a wide variety of projects, including VR meetings products, VR paratrooper simulators, AR applications, and VR training applications for the pro audio industry. Check out the other pages of this site for details around those projects!

If you are interested in discussing potential collaboration or learning more about my skills and experience, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am always open to exploring new opportunities and making connections in the industry.
