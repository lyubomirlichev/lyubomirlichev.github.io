### Project description
The 3D Event Space Planner is a 3D environment authoring tool, designed to significantly reduce friction when planning an event.
The Planner allows the user to construct fully customizable rooms and environments using custom and pre-built assets. The Planner also affords multiple ways to view the experience including free camera, 2D, and first-person view.

### What I worked on

I was responsible for all of the design and implementation of the UI and Input interactions. It was necessary to craft a cohesive UI theme, and to design and implement UI components which aim to assist and guide the user to the capabilities of the software. 

All of the User Interface and interactions seen in the video above and screenshots below were designed, authored, implemented, tested by me.
