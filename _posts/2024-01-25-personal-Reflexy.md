### Developer Overview
This application is the evolution of the Reactor prototype I posted about last year. After I had confidence in the concept, I started a journey of building it in Swift to be ready for the Apple Vision Pro device release.

I've been employed full-time throughout this time,  but I wanted to put this out there for the early adopters, for those who are willing to take a risk. That's why since the device's announcement 8 months ago, I've worked on this every day in the early mornings and late evenings, a few hours at a time, slowly implementing it, testing it, iterating, reworking, bug fixing, designing, reworking again, mastering audio, writing copy, setting up websites, and much more. 

It has been an incredibly humbling journey, as I did not predict the toll it would take on me as a solo developer. I've learned a massive amount about creating a product from scratch and what it takes to release it. Despite that, I loved every bit of it, and I would do it all over again. My goal is and has been for at least one person to download it, and find some joy in it.


I'll be posting more details about lessons learned, what progress looked like and more.
