The Network Rail Signal Switching Simulator has been developed for implementation alongside classroom training and allows students to put into practice the Electrical Control Room (ECR) working procedures and principles provided by traditional instructor-led training.

### What I worked on
While my responsibilities didn't extend to overseeing individual systems, I actively tackled a range of issues by identifying and rectifying various bugs. 

I was tasked with fixing various issues regarding circuit breaker behaviour across the substations, rendering bugs of the rail system's 3D and 2D models, and extensive testing and tweaking of the simulator to match the original system. I was tasked with improving performance, both CPU and GPU bound, by finding ways to save on operations, and employing engine features to optimise performance.
I also worked on verifying, fixing, and cleaning up the extensive dataset which powers the simulator and each of it's scenarios. 

Moreover, I sought opportunities to enhance the existing functionalities, leading to improved system performance and user experience. My immersion in this project not only allowed me to contribute directly to its success but also granted me invaluable insights into its complex workings and interdependencies.
