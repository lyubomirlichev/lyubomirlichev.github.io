### Project description
[Gatherings](https://gatheringsvr.com/support/) is an always on persistent world where you can explore, watch and connect. 
The application allows a VR user to experience a shared space with their colleagues, have meetings, attend events, and explore digital activities.
The application runs on a Unity-based platform, with Azure backend, and Unity frontend. The entire content of the app is delivered in real time, on demand, as part of a platform-level CMS system, using Asset Bundles.

Over three years, Gatherings grew and adapted in numerous ways, taking advantage of new technologies in a rapidly expanding market. Evolving a product that was originally a single user experience, to persistent ecosystems with impressive capabilities to support over 100 users in a single space.

Initially, I was a mid-level software engineer, tasked with implementing and improving the immersive spatial UI. I collaborated closely with the design team and other engineers, to implement a smooth seamless front-end experience, powered by a data-intensive platform.

After the public release of Gatherings, I was moved up to Senior-level, and became part of the team tasked with re-developing and deploying a fully comprehensive CMS system. This new system with a Unity extension front-end afforded the art team with rapid construction of VR spaces. The CMS system supported updating spaces, assets, templates and much more.
