### Project description
The Avatar Customiser Demo is a Proof-Of-Concept Demo produced with the purpose of exploring the capabilities of the Hololens 2 and AR in general in relation to Gatherings VR. 

Users can create avatars in Gatherings VR with the companion app and a photo of themselves. We wanted to imagine and try out what that would look like using AR, more specifically using the Hololens 2. 

In this project, I lead a team of 3, where I was responsible for:
- Resolving obstacles and blockers for the team.
- Requirements gathering, outlining of scope of work.
- Production of roadmap, deliverables, and timescales.
- Breaking down requirements into actionable detailed tickets.
- Managing dependencies between engineering and design.
- Setting up a template Hololens 2 project with Unity.
- Leading day-to-day work of the team including morning check-ins, UI design review, code review, bug fixing, design direction, systems direction, keeping team's focus on deliverables and primary goals.
- Reporting to Director of Engineering on progress, obstacles, successes, and learnings.
- Presenting to CEO/CTO/Eng. Director on the outcome, lessons learned, challenges of the project.
- Producing Demo and showcase materials.

The outcome can be seen below: The Hololens 2 application allows a user to fully configure their avatar from a template and customise their avatar using pre-generated hand-picked selection of assets as accessories.
