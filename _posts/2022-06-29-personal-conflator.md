Conflator is an experimental Unity app, with the concept of conflating API results. Like cooking but with API results.
I use this page https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis to find different APIs which might combine into amusing or interesting results.

### What I worked on
Designed and integrated API in these combinations:
- Kanye Cats - Retrieving a random photo of a cat and combining it with a random tweet by Kanye West.
- Owen Wilson wow quotes - Retrieving a random quote by Owen Wilson saying "wow" and combining that with the movie poster of the containing movie.

#### Future combinations
- Movie Snacks - Getting a random movie and a random snack to combine it with.
- Weather Puns - Getting the current local weather, and getting a random pun based on how hot / cold it is.
