Reactor is a Unity developed prototype for a VR game. The game is a VR-based challenge of reaction. The user is presented with an array of buttons, which are enabled in a random order within a set time limit. The user is rewarded with points as they tap on the active buttons before they go inactive. More tapped buttons within the time limit leads to a higher score.

The purpose of the prototype is to serve as a test environment for the concept of the game. The prototype can be tested with an Meta Quest, which I have. As I build the prototype and figure out what works and what doesn't I can translate those learnings to the next stage. Furthermore, I can architect and implement systems with a familiar Unity engine, I can assemble a coherent game loop, and can provide an example for the next stage of the prototype. 

The next stage is currently to recreate it in Swift using SwiftUI and RealityKit, running on Apple Vision Pro and Vision Pro Simulator. This project is currently in progress.

More details will be added over time.
