Covalent is a roguelike game where (you) the atom fights the other elements to escape a cell.

### What I worked on
Designed and implemented game mechanics:
 - A movable player character represented by an atom made of protons and neutrons, with customisable orbiting electrons.
 - Spawnable enemies with varying strength, based on their assigned element. e.g. Helium, Boron, Hydrogen etc...
 - Hostile enemies with the goal of destroying the player.
 - Player shooting mechanics to allow combat with spawnable enemies.
 - Isometric top-down camera system following player.
